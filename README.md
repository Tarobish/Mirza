# Mirza Arabic Font Project

Mirza is a body text typeface based on the Naskh script, with 4 different weights.
The design aims to observe the rules of Arabic and Persian aesthetics with the help of ligatures.
All Arabic and Persian readers are familiar with the shapes of Mirza's characters, and they are comfortable for reading long texts.
Unlike many other Arabic fonts, Mirza includes a Latin typeface designed for harmony with the Arabic to make it useful for multilingual texts.

# Building

## Dependencies

To build the font files:

* fontTools: https://github.com/behdad/fonttools
* AFDKO (makeotf): http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko.html
* python-fontforge (`>>> import fontforge`): http://fontforge.github.io
* defcon ufo3 branch: https://github.com/typesupply/defcon/tree/ufo3
* unicodedata2: https://github.com/mikekap/unicodedata2

To build the pdf testing documents:

* latexmk: https://www.ctan.org/pkg/latexmk/
* texlive (xetex): https://www.tug.org/texlive/ (http://xetex.sourceforge.net/)

## Build the fonts:

```
.Path/to/Mirza$ make
```

or run the build script directly

```
.Path/to/Mirza$ ./Tools/build.sh
```
This will create all files in the `Fonts` directory

## Testing documents

You should have created/updated the fonts in `Fonts`. See above.


```
.Path/to/Mirza$ make preparedoc
.Path/to/Mirza$ make doc
```

This will generate pdf files in `Generated/Documents`

# Workflow

Mirza was designed using [Glyphs](https://glyphsapp.com/).

The source files are in the `Sources` directory.  `Mirza 2 Masters.glyphs` and `Mirza-LATIN-SOURCE.glyphs`

We use `*.ttf`, `*.otf` and `*.ufo` (for kerning) files generated by Glyphs (with production names)
in the build process. The files are located in the `Generated/Arabic` and `Generated/Latin` directories.

The build process merges the Arabic and Latin sources and generates OT-features for them.

GSUB features are defined in the `*.fea` files in `Sources`.

GPOS features are generated on the fly from the files in `Generated` directories.
`mark` and `mkmk` are taken from the `*.otf` files, `kern` is created from the `*.ufo`s.
