# Mirza Arabic Font Project

Mirza is a body text typeface based on the Naskh script, with 4 different weights. 
The design aims to observe the rules of Arabic and Persian aesthetics with the help of ligatures. 
All Arabic and Persian readers are familiar with the shapes of Mirza's characters, and they are comfortable for reading long texts. 
Unlike many other Arabic fonts, Mirza includes a Latin typeface designed for harmony with the Arabic to make it useful for multilingual texts.
