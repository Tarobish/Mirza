# Online Font Project

A small supporter for fonts projects that are hosted online on GitHub-Pages or any other simple HTTP server.

The Idea is to bundle and configure a list of purely browser-based apps that can help you making fonts.

The main target group is free/libre font projects hosted on GitHub. But
if you like this you can also deploy it on your private server, even in
your intranet. It is itself free/libre software.

## The Tools

### available

 * Live Testing: a modified version of https://github.com/graphicore/urlhosted
   to provide live testing of fonts and to make it easy to file issues.
   The first incarnation of this was for [Jomhuria](http://tarobish.github.io/Jomhuria/#live)
   [used in the issue tracker](https://github.com/Tarobish/Jomhuria/issues/33).

### planned

 * Charset-Inspector: https://github.com/graphicore/charset-inspector
   visualize the unicode character set defined by the font and compare
   it to character sets of other  fonts.
 * always interested in more


## Contributions

are very welcome! I suggest that the Apps provided here should have a repository
of their own and be just distributed and configured from here. But that only
if it's feasible.

## Installation

This will involve using bower and writing some configuration by hand. Later
we can probably provide some helping command line tool.

TODO: *flesh this out*
